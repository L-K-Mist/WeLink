<p><strong>The User&#39;s Experience is in the Details</strong>
  m
So coming back to Google&#39;s Material Design Philosophy:
The team behind Material Design recognized that there&#39;s always a gap between the user and the things they see on the screen - that gap is the physical glass between the user and the pixels.</p>
<p>Next time you&#39;re on a google site, watch carefully how the buttons respond to a click or touch event.</p>
<p>A ripple emanates from the point where you clicked/touched - not just from the center of the button, no: <em>from the point where contact was <strong>made</strong></em>. The button then pops up - sort of sucks up - to bridge the gap of the glass and touch your finger! The magic&#39;s in the details...</p>
