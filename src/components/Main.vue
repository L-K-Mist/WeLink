                  <p>We stand on the shoulders of Giants, and this website is no exception!</p>
                  <p>None of this would have been possible AND performant, without the latest developments (on top of last year&#39;s latest developments) in programming.</p>
                  <p>Big thanks to </p>
                  <hr>
                  <p>Vue for being the over-all Reactive, Performant, Front-End Framework.</p>
                  <p>Why we chose vue over React and Angular:</p>
                  <p>Although each is great, capable of producing similarly functional websites/apps; (Gmail is built on Angular, Facebook on React) we find that vue is lighter, nimbler, and independent.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p>Vuetify for it&#39;s implementation of Google&#39;s Beautiful Material Design Spec.</p>
                  <p>Vuetify in a nutshell: Vuetify provides the button, card, and slider components generally used in this site.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p>vue-particle for the playful Particle Component you were playing with on the Landing Page Hero Element.</p>
                  <p>Netlify for their (so far free  -  and Supa-Fast) cdn-hosting of this site.</p>
                  <p>Netlify in a nutshell: Netlify is a Helpful Static-Site Hosting solution and Content Delivery Network.</p>
                  <p>So yes, at the moment this is a server-less, <em>static</em> app, served via cdn (Content Delivery Network)</p>

                  <p>Special Mention: NodeJs
                  This site is not - strictly speaking - a Nodejs application; as it doesn&#39;t run off of a NodeJs Server. However, NodeJs is so fundamental to what&#39;s happening on the web right now that we can certainly regard NodeJs as an instrumental part of bringing this site into deployed status.</p>
                  <p>NodeJS in a nutshell - [tough one, I&#39;ll have to come back to that later] sometimes you don&#39;t know what you think you know eh #smileyWink# </p>
                  <p>Okay, basically what they&#39;ve done there is brought javascript out of the browser and into the land of servers and PC&#39;s. Truly: They took Chrome&#39;s aptly-named V8 Engine, and turned it into something that you install on your PC - not exactly; but almost like a second Operating System that speaks Javascript. In essence therefore translating (AKA compiling) into C++ Native. </p>
                  <p>Yis I think this is so wrong, rather check out what better brains than mine have to say: </p>
                  <p>Okay, so who&#39;ve we left out; let me see...</p>
