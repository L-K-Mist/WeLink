        <p>Afterthought: The simple act of saying thanks to the creators of the tools essential to this website&#39;s existence has proved more difficult than I thought - you pull on one thread and the whole of the internet seems to get pulled along with it. ;) Down the rabbit-hole we go then... </p>
        <p>None of this would have been possible AND fast, without the total revamp of web development as we know it.</p>
