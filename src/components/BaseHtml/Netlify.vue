What netlify means to me is that I can host this site as a static site, delivered through a cdn (content delivery network) that spans the globeâ€¦ and so far: FOR FREE!
</p>
<p>
In order to attract developers aiming for world-wide, hundreds-of-views-per-day, high-traction apps; netlify offers the essentials of their hosting and deployment system FOR FREE until the site starts getting the kind of hits that would make its owner happy to pay.
</p>
<p>
Like much of the freemium offers to startups; it's like the web-ecosystem is saying: "Go on, start using my business application and we'll ask you to start paying when it looks like you can afford it."

Here is netlify's founder talking about what his team's thinking is offering to "the wild".
