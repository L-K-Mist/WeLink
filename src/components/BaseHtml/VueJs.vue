        <p>VueJs is our benevolent over-all Front-End Framework - the thing we plug the other frameworks into (mostly).</p>
        <p>Why vue? </p>
        <p><strong>It is: </strong></p>
        <ul class="ml-3">
        <li>Reactive</li>
        <li>Performant</li>
        <li>Light</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>React and Angular (of Facebook and Gmail fame respectively) are great, but sometimes tight budgets and small teams result in even more frugal and inclusive code. </p>
        <p>Plus there&#39;s an air of victory around Evan You&#39;s creation - David and Goliath vibes... although he seems to get much love from Google?  :) [use chips plus smileys]</p>
        <p>Although each is great, capable of producing similarly functional websites/apps; I find that vue is, nimbler, independent, and - for me - easier to learn.</p>
