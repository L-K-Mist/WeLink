          Web-Pack is currently the mystery box for me: I know it's doing an awesome job down there in the pit - basically crunching all that complicated stuff with libraries and whatnot, down to the simplest of static html, css and javascript  - but understand it? No - not yet. Plenty of gaps in Causal Knowledge there.
          </p>
          <p>
          Every day new gaps get filled in. Still, I'll give it a go from memory:
          </p>
          <h4>WebPack in a Nutshell: </h4>


          <p>
          It takes all the fancy code (NodeJs Modules, Templating Language, and a hell of a lot of separate files that make up the VueJs Development Environment), and via Babel, compiles that to good ol' fashioned:
          </p>

          <ul class="ml-3">

          <li>Vanilla Javascript
          <li>Vanilla CSS
          <li>Vanilla HTML</li></ul>

          <br>
          <p>
          By way of demonstration:
          </p>
          <p>
          The development version of this webapp has the following files, bites, and Folders
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>      15982 File(s)    123 798 908 bytes
                    8384 Dir(s)   </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong> </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
          within which is the dist folder (for online deployment) created by WebPack
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>         37 File(s)      5 209 360 bytes
                      23 Dir(s)
          </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
          In more advance apps, this static rendering you're seeing here (animations and all) would represent the app-shell. These visuals, plus a server api, and some real-time sockets, and you've got a full-blown real-time app like whatsapp or facebook!
          </p>
          <p>
          That's what's coming soon here! :)
