    <p>This site is not - strictly speaking - a Nodejs application; as it doesn&#39;t run off of a NodeJs Server. However, NodeJs is so fundamental to what&#39;s happening on the web right now that we can certainly regard NodeJs as an instrumental part of bringing this site into deployed status.</p>
    <p><strong>NodeJS in a nutshell </strong>- [tough one, I&#39;ll have to come back to that later] sometimes you don&#39;t know what you think you know eh #smileyWink# </p>
    <p>In essence NodeJs brings Javascript to the land of PC&#39;s and servers - For Web-Developers that means no need to learn other languages for server-side implementations. It&#39;s javascript from the server to the browser and on the device.</p>
    <p>They took Chrome&#39;s aptly-named V8 Engine, and turned it into something that you install on your PC - not exactly; but almost like a second Operating System that speaks Javascript. In essence therefore translating (AKA compiling) into C++ Native... or something like that.</p>
